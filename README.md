1. Numeric vs Categorical Data

The "steps" dataframe has the following NUMERIC features:
> Calories_Burned, Steps, Distance, Floors, Minutes_Sedentary, Minutes_Lightly_Active, Minutes_Fairly_Active, Minutes_Very_Active, Activity_Calories

The "steps" dataframe has the following CATEGORICAL features:
> Date

The "sleep" dataframe has the following NUMERIC features:
> Minutes_Asleep, Minutes_Awake, Number_of_Awakenings, Time_in_Bed

The "sleep" dataframe has the following CATEGORICAL features:
> Date

Or, after combining the "steps" and "sleep" dataframes:

The NUMERIC DATA are:
> Calories_Burned, Steps, Distance, Floors, Minutes_Sedentary, Minutes_Lightly_Active, Minutes_Fairly_Active, Minutes_Very_Active, Activity_Calories, Minutes_Asleep, Minutes_Awake, Number_of_Awakenings, Time_in_Bed

The CATEGORICAL DATA are:
> Date_x, Date_plusOne, Date_y
